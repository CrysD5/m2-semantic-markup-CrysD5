        You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.

        When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do
    </h2>
    <p class="small">
        <!-- description -->
        At least, not anymore...

    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h3 class="bold">Want bold text?</h3>
    <p class="bold">
        <!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
        There's a wrong way and a <strong>right way</strong>. Always use the right way!

    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h3 class="italic"> Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
    <p class="italic">
        <!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
        Again, it used to be done <em>like this</em>. This is wrong. This is the right way.

    <h2 class="separation">Separation of concerns</h2>
    <!-- description -->
    <p id="separation">
        The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!

    <!-- title for next section -->
    <h2 id="links">Links</h2>
    <p class="links">
        <!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
        Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from <a href="https://www.thesolusproject.com/" target="_blank">place</a>
        to <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_talos_principle_gold_edition" target="_blank">place</a> on the internet.

    <!-- title for next section -->
       <h2 class="sections">Sections</h2>
    <!-- go back through and group each section correctly
         stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
       <p class="sections">Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this</p>
